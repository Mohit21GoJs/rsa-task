## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to [security@yourcompany.com](mailto:security@yourcompany.com) with the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

After submitting a vulnerability report, you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 2 business days.

2. **Initial Assessment**: We will perform an initial assessment of the report within 5 business days.

3. **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process.

4. **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 90 days of the initial report.

## Security Measures

### Development Security

- **Code Review**: All code changes require review before merging
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- **Secret Scanning**: Automated detection of accidentally committed secrets
- **Static Analysis**: Code is analyzed for security issues using CodeQL and Semgrep
- **Container Scanning**: Docker images are scanned for vulnerabilities

### Infrastructure Security

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Services run with minimal required permissions
- **Network Segmentation**: Components are isolated where possible
- **Encryption**: Data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Controls**: Multi-factor authentication required for sensitive operations
- **Monitoring**: Security events are logged and monitored

### Data Protection

- **Data Minimization**: We collect only necessary data
- **Secure Storage**: Sensitive data is encrypted and access-controlled
- **Data Retention**: Data is retained only as long as necessary
- **Privacy by Design**: Privacy considerations are built into the development process

## Responsible Disclosure

We practice responsible disclosure and ask that security researchers do the same:

1. **Give us reasonable time** to investigate and fix the issue before public disclosure
2. **Do not access or modify data** that does not belong to you
3. **Do not perform attacks** that could harm the reliability or integrity of our services
4. **Do not use social engineering** against our employees or contractors

## Recognition

We believe that coordinated vulnerability disclosure is in the best interest of both our users and the security community. Security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities following this policy may be eligible for:

- Public recognition in our security acknowledgments (with your permission)
- Direct communication with our security team
- Priority handling of your report

## Security Updates

Security updates and advisories will be published:

- In the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/your-org/repo/security/advisories) section
- In release notes for applicable versions
- On our security mailing list (if applicable)

## Contact
